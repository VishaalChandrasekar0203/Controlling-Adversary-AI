# Controlling-Adversary-AI
Tell stories with AI 

In this age of rapidly growing AI, an average 75% of the kids now a days have a phone at the age of 12.
Still third of AI community thinks AI can do side ways 
If adults don't believe in AI, How would they belive AI in the hands of their children 

Goal:
Write stories for children without harmful text and simplified text generation process.

Updated goal: 
security depried AI API - pull into any system and the AI adapts to the own domain
starting with childrens stories 
 AI model to adapt to AI models and provides with the best security that is sutiable for it's own.

Things to be achived  in this project :
Evaluation of baises
Risk management
Elimination of toxicity 
Non-harmful text generation 
Controlled hallucinations
Easy content generation 

Base : 
use facebook llama2
RoBerta Modelling 
NLP Integration 
find a way through large dataset
Masking techniques 
More efficient , more epoches

Trail 1:
Using of 2 activation functions in one nn
Implement security on AI 

Trail 2: 
while using optimizer, adding ARCA - coordinate accent algorithm 
Iteratively updating a token 

Output:
Restrictions of words, controlled outcomes 
Improvinf the capability of learning the non harmful way

Adversary machine learning 
AML is the process of extracting information about the behaviour and characteristics of a machine learning model 
Also, learning to manipulate the input into a ML model in order to reach a better outcome (This project: also restrict the output)
